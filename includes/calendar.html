      This is the Spring 2015 schedule! The summer schedule is currently being
      updated, but you can expect the content to be roughly the same ordering.
      Every 2 weeks of Spring correspond to 1 week of summer. Thus: Weeks 1 and 2
      will become week 1.
      <br /><br />

      Quest: July 8 (in class, 1 hour)
