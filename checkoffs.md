# Lab Check-Off Questions


<div class="page-section" markdown="1">

## Directions

**All lab check-off deadlines are at 11:59PM.**
(However, you need to get checked off by a TA or lab assistant, so you last chance to get checked off is during lab or office hours.)

To get checked off, you should prepare answers to the specific questions for each lab. You shouldn't feel compelled to memorize every single detail of lab. The goal here to make sure you're on track with CS10 and you should be comfortable with the higher level concepts for each question. For each lab the first questions are the biggest ideas, and the later questions are for your own benefit and review.

Note that you only need to get checked off for 1 lab each week! You get to pick which lab you'd like to get checked off for, and we encourage you to get checked off for whatever is the **most** challenging. You'll get credit for effort, and getting close to the answer, so this is a great way to check in with your TA and Lab Assistants.

**Remember:** Even if you miss a check-off deadline, you can still get 50% credit for any lab check off at any time during the semester.

* Show me your `find number in a sorted list` block. What algorithm are you using in this block and how does it work?
* Why was the binary search technique so much faster than trying to find a number in an unsorted list? Is it actually faster when considering the time needed to sort the list initially?

* If the number of inputs, N, doubles, how would that change the Worst Case for `find number in sorted list`?
* How can we objectively measure which algorithm, sorted or unsorted, is faster. What kind of extra work is required for the sorted algorithm? Are there cases where unsorted might be faster?
* What is memoization? If you were able to implement it in the `find number in sorted list (memoized)` block, what makes memoization faster?
* In your experimental `Number-guessing` game, which algorithm did you find to be faster? Why? What type of search is `Higher/Lower` representing?
* What happened with the time it took for your computer to counter up the numbers between 1 and x when you started doubling the numbers? Tripling the numbers? What do you think would happen with the time I multiplied your top number by 8?
* Please show me your Non-Gauss and Gauss `Add all numbers in`.  Which was faster? Why?
* Please show me your `Are the numbers of (LIST) distinct?` block. What is the difference between "Worst-Case" and "Best Case" in terms of Runtime?
* Of all the runtimes you have discovered thus far, can you rank them from “fastest” to “slowest”? Why is runtime important for the programs that we create?`

# Week 5: Labs 10 and 11: Due 7/27

## Lab 10:  Practice with HOFs and Functions as Data {#lab10}
#### Required Questions

1. How can we use functions as data in Snap? What do the “call” and “run” blocks do, and what’s the difference between them? 
2. Demonstrate your `list all factorions between __ and __ ` block.
3. Demonstrate your `is __ pandigital?` block.

#### Self-Check Questions

1. How does the `compose` block work?

## Lab 11:  Tic-Tac-Toe {#lab11}
* How are lists used to implement the tic-tac-toe board? Why does this strategy work? Would this strategy work even with a larger board?
* Show your `appearances` or `substitute triple` block, and explain your implementation (You could be asked either, so be prepared for both!).
* What did you find to be the most pivotal block in your creation of the game? Show the code for this block, explain your implementation of it works, and explain how the game would have not worked without it.
* The lab mentioned a few core rules that are part of everyone's tic-tac-toe strategy (in the Program Structure and Strategy section), and thus encouraged them as part of your computer program. It went on to say “Humans don't always think alike about the in-between rules; we'll make suggestions later, after you finish the minimal assignment.”
Why do humans not always think alike about the “in-between rules”? Can you give an example of how two people might think differently about an “in-between rule” and explain the difficulties in implementing that in a program?
* Show your `winning-square` or full `ttt` block (Again, you could be asked either, so be ready for both!).
* When was it best to report positions for some of the tic-tac-toe blocks, and when was it more ideal to report actual letters (‘X’ or ‘O’)? Relate your explanations back to domain and range.
